# Contributing


## Workflow:


1. Fork the repo
2. Clone your fork
3. Add original repo as remote "upstream"
3. Create an issue for the task / fix in the upstream (original) repo
4. Assign yourself to the issue so we know who's doing what
5. Create a branch on your fork referencing the issue number (if issue #232 is what you're working on call it issue-232)
6. Do all your work on that branch **DO NOT WORK ON MASTER BRANCH**
7. Commit and push to your fork **Not upstream**
8. Create pull request and wait to have it reviewed so we dont break *everything*
